        <h4>Darjeeling and Ganktok</h4>
        <p>On a summer day, the fragrance of tea leaves lifts off the hills and hover over Darjeeling like a hat and the wonderful things breathes unsaid inside that, like the bent trees, the happy earthworms, the reluctant tea-colored puddles, flowering Rhododendrons and Magnolia plants and the wild garden flowers blooming in different colors of rainbow and a British bungalow growing a fragile façade of greenery for ages amidst a sprawling tea garden.</p>
